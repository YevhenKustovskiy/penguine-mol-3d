# penguinemol3d
PenguineMol3D is an open source package written in Python3, which utilizes OpenGL python binding (https://pyopengl.sourceforge.net) for rendering of small compounds' 3D models. Initially, the RDKit Mol object is created from data in a file (e.g, MOL\SDF, MOL2 format); the Mol object is further passed as an argument to the Mol3D class constructor, which generates a 3D model based on atom coordinates of the Mol object conformer. During the initialization stage user has to setup a scene by creating MolecularScene object and adding all necessary components like molecule and light sources as it is demonstrated in examples. As a drawing surface for rendering can be used any surface compatible with OpenGL; particularly, provided by such libaries as GLFW (used in examples), PyGame, PyQt, PySide, wxPython, Tkinter + Togl widget, etc.
